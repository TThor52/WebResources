					<a href="http://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> 
					<br /> <br />
					The W3Schools site contains a comprehensive reference of many web resources. These resources benefit all forms or programmers. 
					The tutorials they offer are simple for beginners to understand, and they have built-in, hands on examples that aid in
					understanding the concepts presented. Speaking of the concepts, they have beginner, intermediate, and expert
					concepts useful for programmers of all experience levels. The tutorials are persistent between all concepts
					so experts can still learn in a simple and hands-on environment. The overall design of the site is user-friendly, 
					easy to navigate, pleasing to look at. All of these contribute to a good user experience that helps its users of all levels
					learn and reference a variety of programming techniques in an easy-to-digest manner.

					<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" target="_blank">Tutorials Point</a> 
					<br /><br />
					Tutorials Point contains a variety of programming resources in both video and text format. This website benefits beginners and
					intermediate programmers. This website has tutorials that are hands-on and easy to understand. The is a fair amount of text to go 
					through each section which is slightly daunting. That being said, they are formatted in a way that makes each section visible 
					and easy to read. The videos themselves cover similar topics to their text counter-part and are a good alternative for those 
					who don't want to wade through too much text, or want to reinforce what the text taught. The concepts provided are appropriate 
					for the beginners and intermediate programers it targets. They provide a good base to learn the expert techniques later. Overall, 
					the look of the site is good. It is somewhat basic, and there is quite a bit of white space, but that can be forgiven as they are 
					minor and do not hurt the content of the site.

					<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> <br /><br />
					Stack Overflow is an extremely helpful site where users can ask code related questions, and those same users can answer questions 
					asked by other. There is a large database of questions so it is very likely that a question you have has been answered. 
					This website can be used by programmers of all levels, but the answers given can lean more towards the intermediate and expert 
					end. Like I've mentioned above, there is most likely an answer to a question a programmer has, so it is incredibly reliable when
					it comes to finding answers. That being said, they are user based answers, so the quality may vary, and there are still problems 
					that may arise that this site cannot answer. At least in a straight-forward manner. With all of this being said, its a site I've 
					been using ever since my enrollment into the AAS, so I can attest to all of the above, and wholly recommend this site.

					<a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" target="_blank">HTML Dog</a> 
					<br /><br />
					HTML Dog is a site that focuses on making websites. It has tutorials, examples, tips (refered to as techniques), and references 
					for 3 of the main langauges in web developement: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This website is for all levels of web developers. 
					The tutorials reference beginner, intermediate, and expert techniques for web developers. Each section is small and easy to digest, 
					and covers the topic it discusses well enough. The tips section goes over a few tips you can use to enhance your programming skills.  
					The examples give you hands-on practice with the topics the tutorials discuss. The references go over terms or keywords you might 
					need when you're using the tags in web development. Overall, this website is very clean and offers a fair amount of information. 
					Not as much as the other sites though, and the overall design does not show what you can do with web development too well. Its more 
					basic which is not necessarily a bad thing, and the topics are easy to cover in a short time.

					<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> 
					<br /><br />
					Code Academy is a site that offers various online tutorials that users can take at their own pace. There are a plethora of topics 
					covered such as programming or web development. This website is appropriate for all levels of web developers/programmers. The 
					tutorials the offer range from basic topics to build stable foundations to advanced topics to further enhance your knowledge in a 
					given area. The website does a good job at guiding the user through the tutorials with both a good design, and hands-on tutorials.
					There is also a paid option that allow access to a variety of options to help with learning. Though its worth noting that much can 
					be learned for free so its just that, an option. Overall, the website does a good job of guiding future and current web developers 
					as they learn important concepts for use in the future. The website is very clean, presents its myriad of tutorials well, and 
					show cases its programming concepts very well.

					<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/" target="_blank">Google's Site for Developers</a> 
					<br /><br />
					This website offers a variety of well written articles that cover the fundamentals of good web development as well as 
					advanced techniques to enhance your knowledge, and help you create better websites. This website is approriate for intermediate 
					and expert levels of web developers, as there are little to no articles covering the basics of web development. This website expects 
					you to have a certain degree of compentency when it comes to web development. The articles they do have are extremely informative 
					for the audience they're targeting. They also cover a few topics some of the other sites are lacking such as performance, and 
					security. Overall, this website does a good job of informing its target audience about the intemediate and expert techniques 
					of web design that are lacking in a few other websites. That being said, each article is fairly long, and some of the 
					terminology can go over your head. Nonetheless, a good website when it comes to the more complex techniques to make websites 
					more responsive.

					<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> 
					<br /><br />
					What can I say. Google is the most used search engine in the world. It has access to a variety of websites with information that 
					can help you with your programming needs. Some of which having been mentioned above. This "site" is for all levels of programmers 
					although it may be harder to find answers to questions concerning expert topics due to their rarity or complexity. As long as you 
					know what to search for, this search engine is your invisible best friend. There will be a variety of sources, and the most reliable 
					will probably end up at the top. Being a search engine, your limits are the limits of Google's database of sites, which is to say 
					near endless. That being said, if you don't know what to search for, or how to search for it, it may be frustrating to find what 
					you want or need. There are a massive amounts of resources and knowledge here, but not everything in the world has been covered 
					or researched in detail. Regardless, your invisible best friend is just that for a reason, its incredibly reliable, and, mostly, 
					trustworthy with the information it'll give your.
